The motif in 1d7b: uses part of the Ig core and some inserted strands; hybrid motif. The most important feature in Ig fold is the
interlock composed of strands 2, 3, 5, 6 (if strands in a classic Ig are numbered from 1 to 7), like two scissors arranged mouth-to-mouth.
The motif in 1svb: the first domain in 1svb is almost all meander, so it cannot be homologous to Ig-like proteins.
