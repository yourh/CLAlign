The motif in 1l6r: two strands are insertions; hybrid motif in a Rossmann structure.
In 1ir6: comparing d1ir6a_ and d1k20a_ (same superfamily), domain 2 in these two homologs are not exactly the same. Anyway,
domain 2 does not have a Rossmann-like structure. So the motif in 1l6r and the motif in 1ir6 are analogs.
