The motif in 1g99: compared to d1ig8a1 (same superfamily), two strands are insertion to the RNaseH core. hybrid motif.
The motif in 1gqy: although it looks like a dsRBD, the helix belongs to the Rossmann core because without it, half of the Rossmann sheet is
not covered. So this motif cannot be dsRBD and thus has nothing to do with RNaseH domains (RNaseH is thought to originated from dsRBD).
