The motif in 1aa7 uses helices from the two different domains and the linker helix, and is an interface motif.
Although the first domain in 1aa7_A is also a 4-helix up-and-down bundle, this bundle cannot be homologous to the 4-helix bundle in 1qkr,
because they are mirror images.
Note that in 1qkr paper, the authors mentioned that "five-helix bundles are uncommon,.." in page 606.
