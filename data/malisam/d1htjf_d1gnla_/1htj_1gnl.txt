From the 1htj paper, the last three helices (helix 10-12) are an integral extension of the RGS fold with many hydrophobic interactions.
The last three helices are absent in other RGS, so they are insertions. The 3-helix motif in 1htj is a hybrid, using 1 helix from the
insertion and 2 helices from the RGS core.
