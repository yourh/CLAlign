The motif in 1vk3: if 1vk3 is considered to be an elaborated ferredoxin, one helix and two strands in the motif are insertions. Hybrid motif.
The motif in 1w2i: the last strand does not belong to the ferredoxin core.
These two motifs are analogs. In the superposition, the first ferredoxin strand in 1vk3 will be aligned to the first ferredoxin strand in
1w2i. But that is OK, since they are aligned back-to-back, i.e. the helix-packing face in one strand is aligned to the
non-helix-packing face in the other strand.
