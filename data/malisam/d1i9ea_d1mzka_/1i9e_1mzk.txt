The motif in 1i9e: two strands don't belong to the Ig core; hybrid motif.
Although 1mzk is also Ig-like (the first strand in Ig fold is the 5th strand in 1mzk, according to SCOP's 11 strands numbering), the motif
in 1i9e and the motif in 1mzk can not be homologs: if strands in Ig fold is counted from 1 to 7, all other strands are labeled as i
(insertion), the motif in 1i9e is 34ii56 while the motif in 1mzk is iii127. So no homologous elements are superimposed.
