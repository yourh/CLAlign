The motif is composed of two alpha-hairpins. In 1okr, the C-terminal extension has three helices and is probably a duplicated DNA/RNA-binding 3-helix bundle, only adapted to dimerization.
The motif uses two helices from each chain and is an interface motif. In 1m98, the motif covers two entire duplicates and thus is not an interface motif.  
So the alpha-hairpins in 1okr and 1m98 are probably analogs.
