The motif in 2cst: Although each family in the PLP-dependent transferases superfamily has this motif, this is a hybrid, because PLP-dependent
transferases superfamily is homologous to some flavodoxin proteins. So this motif is a hybrid between the Rossmann-like core and the insertions, and
is therefore analogous to ancient folds like KH.
