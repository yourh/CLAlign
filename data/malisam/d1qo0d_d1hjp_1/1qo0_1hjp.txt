In 1qo0, the motif uses one helix from the flavodoxin core in the first monomer, one helix from the N-terminal extension from the second monomer,
and one helix from the flavodoxin core in the second monomer. This is an interface as well as hybrid motif and is analogous to real RuvA C-like
left-handed 3-helix bundles.
