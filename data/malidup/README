The whole MALIDUP database can be extracted from the file "dup.tar".

I. ABOUT THE "DUP.TXT" FILE

The tab-delimited text file "dup.txt" provides basic information about the duplicated domain pairs in this database.
The information includes: pair name, domain names, domain ranges, SCOP ID, and SCOP classification.
Pair name is generally the SCOP ID of the first domain in that pair.
Domain name is PDB ID followed by an underscore, followed by the chain ID, followed by a number (e.g. 1abc_A1.pdb and 1abc_A2.pdb).


II. ABOUT THE FOLDERS

There is one folder for each domain pair. The folder name is the same as the pair name. Each folder contains:
1. Two PDB files for the two duplicates (e.g. 1abc_A1.pdb and 1abc_A2.pdb).
2. DALI alignment (*.dali.ali) and superposition (*.dali.pdb)
3. FAST alignment (*.fast.ali) and superposition (*.fast.pdb)
4. TM-align alignment (*.tm.ali) and superposition (*.tm.pdb)
5. Manual alignment (*.manual.ali) and superposition (*.manual.pdb)
Three pairs have an alternative manual alignment named *.manual2.ali: d1ahua1, d1efud4, and d1i31a_.


III. ABOUT THE PDB FILES

The two PDB files for the two duplicates are extracted from the original PDB file and then pre-processed in the following ways:
1. The chain ID is changed to A regardless of the original chain ID;
2. The residues are numbered continuously (starting from 1) regardless of the original numbering;
3. If the two duplicates are circularly permuted relative to each other, one of them is re-arranged so that they have the same sequential order of secondary structure elements;
4. If an atom has alternative positions, only the first one will be kept;
5. Chemically modified amino acids are changed to their standard names, e.g. MSE is replaced by MET


IV. ABOUT THE SUPERPOSITION FILES

The superposition files (*.dali.pdb, *.fast.pdb, *.tm.pdb, and *.manual.pdb) are re-constructed from the corresponding alignments (*.dali.ali, *.fast.ali, *.tm.ali, and *.manual.ali) by minimizing the overall RMSD.
In a superposition file, the first duplicate is represented by chain S and the second duplicate is represented by chain A.
The coordinates of the first duplicate are transformed while the coordinates of the second duplicate are the same as in the PDB file.


V. ABOUT THE FORMAT OF THE ALIGNMENTS

A *.*.ali file has 2 lines, one for each domain. Two upper-case letters indicate an aligned position. 
Positions with two small letters, or one small letter and one gap, or one large letter and one gap are NOT aligned.
A domain's sequence in the *.*.ali file matches exactly the CA atoms in its pre-processed PDB file.


VI. ABOUT THE "NOTE.DOC" FILE

The "note.doc" file records the sequence, structure, and functional features found in some difficult pairs.
The manual alignments for these pairs were based on these features.


VII. ABOUT THE REMOVED SUPERFAMILIES

The following superfamilies were removed either because we could not define and align the two structural repeats confidently or because we doubted that the two structural repeats were indeed duplicates:
Phospholipase C/P1 nuclease	(d1ah7__)
Lipase/lipooxygenase domain (PLAT/LH2 domain)	(d1ca1_2)
Fe-only hydrogenase	(d1c4aa1)
Pre-protein crosslinking domain of SecA	(d1m6na1)
Ypt/Rab-GAP domain of gyp1p	(d1fkma1)
Heme oxygenase-like	(d1dvea_)

The following superfamilies containing very short structural repeats were also removed:
WW domain	(d1o6wa1)
Zn2/Cys6 DNA-binding domain	(d1d66a1)
Bromelain inhibitor VI (cysteine protease inhibitor)	(d2bi6h1)
C2H2 and C2HC zinc fingers	(d1bbo_1)
Glucocorticoid receptor-like (DNA-binding domain)	(d1ctl_1)
Heparin-binding domain from vascular endothelial growth factor	(d2vgh__)
L domain-like	(d1a9nc_)
Metallothionein	(d2mhu__)
RNI-like	(d2bnh__)
Retrovirus zinc finger-like domains	(d1eska_)
Trimeric LpxA-like enzymes	(d1krra_)
